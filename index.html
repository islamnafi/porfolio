                <p>Hey there! I'm Nafiul Islam - a Mechanical Engineer by fate, a Computer Science grad student by passion, and a tech enthusiast by pure commitment. I started my journey at the Military Institute of Science and Technology, where I tackled the "joys" of heat transfer (what makes me so hot), fluid mechanics (what to do when the sewage system fails), and robotics (teaching metal to move).<br>
                So, after serving my sentence in mechanical's jail, I jumped straight into a master's in Computer Science at United International University. Was it a risky move? Sure. But let's see where it takes me.
