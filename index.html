            Hi, I’m Nafiul Islam. My journey has been anything but conventional, blending engineering, computer science,
            and business into one exciting narrative.<br />I earned my bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from
            the Military Institute of Science and Technology, where I explored a wide array of subjects. While
            mechanical design, robotics, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and heat transfer intrigued me, my true
            passion always lay elsewhere: computers. My fascination with technology began in 8th grade when I was
            introduced to programming and the magic of what happens behind the scenes. That first spark turned into a
            lifelong interest in both hardware and software. I even spent my free time building computers, because why
            stop at knowing how they work when you can assemble them yourself?<br />The competitive nature of university
            admissions in Bangladesh led me to mechanical engineering instead of my first choice, computer science.
            While it wasn’t my initial passion, I embraced the challenge, and along the way, I discovered a strong
            interest in composite materials, manufacturing, and production processes. These experiences broadened my
            perspective and shaped my analytical and problem-solving skills.<br />Determined to pursue my passion, I
            transitioned into computer science after graduation by enrolling in a master’s program at United
            International University. Yes, it was an unconventional shift, but I see it as an opportunity to combine my
            engineering background with the computational skills I’ve always wanted to develop.<br />Alongside
            academics, I’ve also ventured into business development, focusing on the IT and energy sectors. This career
            path has given me valuable insight into bridging technical expertise with strategic thinking. On top of
            that, I dedicate time to personal projects, combining creativity with technical problem-solving to keep
            learning and growing.<br />Through it all, I’ve learned that whether it’s engineering, programming, or
            business, passion and persistence can create the most rewarding outcomes—even if the path isn’t the one you
            originally planned.
